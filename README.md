# web-scraping

* Welcome to the Web Scraping project repository! This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions for usage.

* 📖 Overview

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. This project demonstrates how to use Python-based tools and libraries for web scraping. It includes examples and templates to help you quickly build your own scrapers.

🚀 Features

* Extract data from static and dynamic web pages.

* Parse HTML and XML documents.

* Support for handling JavaScript-heavy websites.

* Rate limiting and error handling to prevent blocking.

* Export data to CSV, JSON, or databases.

📦 Technologies Used

* Python:
 
> Programming language.

* BeautifulSoup:

> Parsing HTML and XML.

* Requests:

> Sending HTTP requests.

* Selenium:

> Handling JavaScript-heavy websites.

* Pandas:

> Processing and exporting data.

🛠️ Setup & Installation:

1. Clone the repository.
> git clone https://github.com/your_username/web-scraping.git
cd web-scraping
2. Create a virtual environment (optional).
> python -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies.
> pip install -r requirements.txt

🔧 Usage

1. Choose your target website: Update the config.json or the script directly with the website URL and parameters.

2. Run the scraper

> python scraper.py

3. Export the data: Data is automatically saved to the output folder in your preferred format (CSV/JSON).

🌟 Best Practices

1. Respect Website Policies: Check the website’s robots.txt file before scraping.

2. Avoid Overloading Servers: Use rate limiting or time delays between requests.

3. Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement try-except blocks and handle HTTP errors.

4. Stay Updated: Websites frequently change their structure; adapt your scraper as needed.
